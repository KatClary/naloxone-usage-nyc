  <h2>Usage of the Opioid Overdose Reversal Drug Naloxone Increased 30% in New York City from 2019 to 2020. What Should We Expect for 2021?</h2>

<p>Naxolone, the opioid reversal medicine administered via nasal spray, has risen in popularity throughout the U.S. as the nation is gripped by an opioid epidemic. New York City has been hit particularly hard, with 2,000 individuals dying of a drug overdose in 2020, the highest number since reporting began in 2000.
</p>

<p>As overdoses increase, so too does usage of the medicine. According to data compiled by the Department of Health, Naloxone was administered by Emergency Medical Services almost 30% more in 2020 than it was in 2019 (8,484 times versus 6,503 times, respectively.)

<p>This could be considered good news. For each usage of the medicine, one would hope for one less lost life. According to an article by the Pew Research Center, increasing the availability of naloxone reduces the rate of opioid overdose deaths.
  Additionally, increasing access to Naloxone does not increase nonmedical opioid use.
</p>

<p>Dr. Janie Simmons, founder of New York-based harm prevention group <i>Get Naloxone Now</i>, said that the need to remove stigma from drug use is urgent. "Stigma is still huge. There are still parents who lose their children and are unwilling to say how they died," said Simmons. "We've also had a huge increase in overdose death during the pandemic."

<p>New York City recently released their third quarter Opioid Antagonist Report, which is a quarterly report issued by the city that details how many officers are trained to administer the medicine. Nearly 25,000 NYPD officers are now trained.</p>

<p>"When I do trainings I say, 'You wouldn't tell a diabetic that they've got to get off insulin,'" said Simmons. "But we think of addiction as more of a moral failure, and it's leading people to their deaths."
